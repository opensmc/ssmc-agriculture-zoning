# Methodology

Using zoning codes posted online, OpenSMC researched the parameters of keeping bees, chickens and other domestic animals, and gardens in each city in the County. This research was then reviewed by Sustainable San Mateo County and sent to planning departments in each city for quality assurance and accuracy. The city responses are included in the details section of this site.

To obtain residential zoning boundaries, OpenSMC used the County's parcel layer to select parcels for residential zoning boundaries for each city by zoning boundary. For cities and towns that make zoning boundaries available as geographic information systems-compatible files, those files were used. Given the home-based nature of the project, only residential zoning boundaries were created. Each zoning boundary for a city was dissolved to create simplified, multipart polygons.

The residential zoning boundaries and the research were then joined together and loaded as a single file into CARTO, the mapping platform OpenSMC selected for the project.
