# Methodology

OpenSMC, the San Mateo County Code for America Brigade, collaborated with Sustainable San Mateo County to create the 3Bs project, an opportunity for residents of San Mateo County cities to learn more about what they can do to participate in hyperlocal food systems.

Using zoning codes posted online, OpenSMC researched the parameters of keeping bees, chickens and other domestic animals, and gardens in each city in the County. This research was then reviewed by Sustainable San Mateo County and sent to planning departments in each city for quality assurance and accuracy. The city responses are included in the details section of the [SSMC site](http://www.sustainablesanmateo.org/3Bs).

To obtain residential zoning boundaries, OpenSMC used the County's parcel layer to select parcels for residential zoning boundaries for each city by zoning boundary. Given the home-based nature of the project, only residential zoning boundaries were created. Each zoning boundary for a city was dissolved to create simplified, multipart polygons.

The residential zoning boundaries and the research were then joined together and loaded as a single file into CARTO, the mapping platform OpenSMC selected for the project.
