Spoke with EPA Planning department July 2016.

Two important things to note:

1) EPA is planning to redo their zoning, likely toward the end of 2016.

2) The zoning areas marked "S2" "S3" "S5" or "S7" represent special
   "combining" district for commercial that add more detail to the
   underlying zoning. The underlying zone, C-1 or R-2, is of primary
   importance. The S* designator defines details for the width of
   the parcel, the minimum frontage, setbacks for front/sides/back,
   the % of the parcel that could be built upon, etc.
