Notes on Pacifica how-to.

Worked on Linux systems with QGIS, ogr2ogr and GIMP open-source tools.

Used ../clip.sh script to clip the overall county map to the city
bounaries for Pacifica and extract the city streets and city parcels.

After calling Pacifica planning department and talking with a few
people there, it's clear they do not have a GIS system. Or a better
map of zoning than the PDF document titled "City of Pacifica Zoning Maps
Edited February 2001 City of Pacifica Planning Department." That is a 
50 page document with 47 pages of maps to print out side-by-side and
tape together, essentially.

So grabbed the city zoning files from the web. Printed, and started
taping together, but after doing the first 9 of the 47 pages, it
looked like the maps had slightly-varying overlaps (from "none" to
"a little"), so started thinkin about doing a master chart in
photoshop. Or the free alternative to photoshop, GIMP.

Made huge GIMP file as a two-color image, and imported PDF sheets
4..50 as individual GIMP layers at 150 DPI. Layers came in with page
numbers, so renumbered those to correspond to the panel number
(1..47), and laid out sheets side-by-side next to each other in
roughly right places.

Cloned each layer to a 'N-shrunk' layer, and clipped the 'shrunk' layer
to (approximately) the map panels themselves, and hid the corresponding
'raw' layers.

Status: Have made all shrunk layers, starting to move them together
by beginning mid-map (panel 18/19).

Moved the 'shrunk' layers together, and refined clipping and
rotatation slightly as needed.

Seems to work best if each 'shrunk' layer is made transparent execpt
for the ink. In GIMP, that's done by selecting the white with color
select, then (in the layer dialog) right-clicking on the layer to add
a mask. In the dialog that appears, set the mask to be by selection,
inverted. Then immediately right-click on the layer again and apply the
mask. Finally, use select > all (control-A) to drop the selection.
But not only do layers sometimes overlap, they sometimes are rotated
vs one another. Might be worth playing with hugin align image stack.

Merged all shrunk layers into a single 'final' layer, and
exported that as a large TIFF.


================================================================

Manual stank.

So wrote pdf_process to extract PDF pages as TIFF files, and 
will try to use Hugin to combine them.

Requires ImageMagick and Hugin.

To make the TIFF files for Hugin, invoke pdf_process as 
       ./pdf_process.sh Zoning\ Maps.pdf foo 4 50 -3

I had to hand-massage the crop geometry to balance not grabbing too
much vs clipping the map. Some panels (#24, #25, #27) are very big.
Other panels (#3, #6, #24) have a 'box' that extends pretty far into
the picture.
